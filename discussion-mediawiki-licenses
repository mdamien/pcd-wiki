Hello! Sorry for writing in English. It was noted that on this wiki upload is not fully functional for users, who will experience a very difficult and/or [[wmf:Resolution:Licensing policy|illegal]] uploading. In fact, the [[MediaWiki:Licenses|licenses/copyright tags dropdown]] is empty, making it hard or impossible to comply with copyright requirements during upload itself.

Presumably, you don't have interest nor energies to have [[commons:Category:Licensing templates|hundreds templates]] with the [[mw:Multimedia/Media Viewer/Template compatibility|now required HTML]], even less a local [[m:EDP|EDP]].
I propose to have
* '''[[Special:Upload|local "{{int:upload}}"]] [[commons:Commons:Turning off local uploads|restricted]]''' to the "{{int:group-sysop}}" group (for emergency uploads) and
* the '''sidebar point to [[commons:Special:UploadWizard]]''',
so that you can avoid local maintenance and all users can have a functioning, easy upload interface [[translatewiki:Special:Translate/ext-uploadwizard|in their own language]]. All registered users can upload on Commons and [[Special:ListFiles|existing files]] will not be affected.

All this will get done around 2014-07-03.
# If you disagree with the proposal, just [[m:User:Nemo bis/Unused local uploads|remove your wiki from the list]]. Remember also to create [[MediaWiki:Licenses]] locally with any content (see a [[s:fr:MediaWiki:Licenses|simple example]]), or uploads will be soon disabled anyway by MediaWiki itself (starting in [[mw:MediaWiki_1.24/Roadmap|version 1.24wmf11]]).
# To make the UploadWizard even better, please tell your experience and ideas on [[commons:Commons:Upload Wizard feedback]].
