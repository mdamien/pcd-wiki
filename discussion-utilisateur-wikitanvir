<div style="padding: 12px 18px 5px 15px; width: absolute; border: 2px solid #000; background: #F5F5F5; color: #000; text-align: justify;">The purpose of this user page is to point you to the right direction where you can contact me in need. Please do not leave your message here, otherwise in most cases, they will not be noticed in time and eventually be removed.

However, you are encouraged to contact me or say hello. :-)

Please note that I can communicate in either Bangla or English. My apologies for not knowing your language.

If you prefer to leave me a message, please choose any of the following talk pages I maintain frequently.
* [[m:User talk:Wikitanvir|Meta-Wiki talk page]]
* [[m:bn:User talk:Wikitanvir|Bangla Wikipedia talk page]] (my home wiki)
* [[m:en:User talk:Wikitanvir|English Wikipedia talk page]]
* [[m:commons:User talk:Wikitanvir|Wikimedia Commons talk page]]

If you have something to say to me in private, e-mail is a good option.
* If you are logged in to your Wikimedia account you can probably e-mail me by [[Special:EmailUser/Wikitanvir|clicking here]].
* Otherwise, you can e-mail me directly to <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">{{PAGENAME}}</span>[[File:At sign.svg|17px|&nbsp;at&nbsp;|link=]]gmail.com.

Finally, if you are interested to know about my work or myself, they can be found on [[m:User:Wikitanvir|my Meta-Wiki user page]].
