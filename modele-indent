The indenter [[Template:Indent]] puts a newline and indents the specified count of spaces.

'''Usage:''' <nowiki>{{</nowiki>indent|''# of spaces''}}
* Indents up to 30 spaces, mixing en-size & em-size spaces.
* Indent differs from {{tl|space}} only in that it automatically begins a wrapped-newline, then spaces<br>across ''n'' spaces, whereas {{tl|space}} spaces over ''n'' in the same (current) line.

'''Example ''(indenting by 5)'':'''&nbsp; Some text.<nowiki>{{</nowiki>indent|5}}Some more text.
<br>'''''Result:'''''<br>
Some text.{{indent|5}}Some more text.

For more detailed examples, and for comparisons with colon-shifts ":" or "::" for indenting,<br>see the full documentation: [[Template:Indent/doc]].

Also see: {{tl2|in|n}} - to shift by ''n'' equal-size spaces.
