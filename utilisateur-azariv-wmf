My name is Alex Zariv, I am a [[wmf:Job_openings/Fundraiser_Production_Coordinator|Production Coordinator]] with the [[wmf:Main Page|Wikimedia Foundation]] and am working on this year's [[m:Fundraising 2011|fundraiser]]. This account is used for edits while officially representing the foundation. In my volunteer capacity I can usually be found on [[m:|meta]] where I am an elected administrator. 

You can reach me either through [[Special:EmailUser/Azariv|e-mail]] or on my Meta-Wiki [[m:User talk:Azariv|talk page]]. On wiki (on all wmf projects) I am [[m:User:Az1568|Az1568]] in my volunteer role and [[m:User:Azariv|Azariv]] in my WMF role.
