My name is James Alexander, I am an Associate Community Officer with the [[wmf:Main Page|Wikimedia Foundation]] and am working to help with this year's [[m:fundraising 2010|Fundraiser]]. This account is used for edits while officially working for the foundation. You can reach me either through email (Jalexander[[File:At_sign.svg|17px| at |link=]]wikimedia.org) or on my [[m:User talk:Jalexander|Meta talk page]]. 

On wiki I use [[m:User:Jamesofur|Jamesofur]] in my volunteer role and this account [[m:User:Jalexander|Jalexander]] in my WMF staff role. In my volunteer capacity I can usually be found on the [[w:en:Main page|enWikipedia]], [[w:simple:Main page|SimpleWikipedia]] or on [[m:Main page|MetaWiki]] where I am an elected administrator as well as working on cross-wiki abuse as a [[m:Global sysop|Global sysop]]
