Hello! I am <span class="plainlinks userlinks">[[User:Osiris|Osiris]] ([[User talk:Osiris|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Osiris|contribs]] · [[Special:DeletedContributions/Osiris|deleted contribs]] · [{{fullurl:Special:Log|user=Osiris}} logs] · [{{fullurl:Special:AbuseLog|wpSearchUser=Osiris}} edit filter log] · [[Special:Block/Osiris|block user]] · [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=block&page=User:Osiris}} block log])</span>.

Most of my activity on this project will be related to patrolling recent changes and reverting vandalism. You will find me most active on the [[w:en:User talk:Osiris|English]] and [[w:simple:User talk:Osiris|Simple English Wikipedias]], [[commons:User talk:Osiris|Commons]], [[m:User talk:Osiris|Meta]] and [[incubator:User talk:Osiris|Incubator]]. You can post to my talk page here, but I might be slow in replying.
