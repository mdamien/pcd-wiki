==On Wiki==
I am the Head of Reader Relations for the Wikimedia Foundation.  My role is to represent, on the staff, the voice and needs of the vast majority of the users of Wikimedia projects: the readers who rarely or never edit.  I can be reached via email at philippe[[File:At_sign.svg|17px| at |link=]]wikimedia.org or [[m:User:Philippe (WMF)|on my meta talk page]].  In my volunteer capacity, I can usually be found on en:Wikipedia or meta, where I am an elected administrator.  I previously was, by virtue of my job, a bureaucrat on the [[strategy:Main Page|Wikimedia Strategic Planning wiki]].

I was a member of the election committee for the Board of Trustees in 2007, 2008, and 2009, and am the staff liaison to the committee for 2011.

You can find me on en:Wikipedia as [[:en:User:Philippe|Philippe]] as a volunteer, or as [[:en:User:Philippe (WMF)|Philippe (WMF)]] in my staff role.  On IRC, my username is usually Philippe.  

Follow me on identi.ca and Twitter!  My username is philippewiki in both places.
