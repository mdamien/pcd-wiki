Hi, I am especially active on my home wiki, the Dutch Wikipedia. I edit sporadicly articles on the English, Afrikaans and French Wikipedia. Sometimes you can find me on global projects like Meta and Commons.

I live in the southern part of the Netherlands, near the Dutch city of [[m:w:en:Heerlen|Heerlen]]. I am interested in languages, sports, computers, the Internet and several other things. In real life I am a copywriter, a student and a supporter of the [[m:w:en:Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] club [[m:w:en:Roda JC|Roda JC Kerkrade]]. 

If you want to contact me, you can leave a message on this wiki. For "emergencies", it probably works faster to leave a message on my [[m:w:nl:User talk:Velocitas|Dutch talk page]]. Thanks in advance!
