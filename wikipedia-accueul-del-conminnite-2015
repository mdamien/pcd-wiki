== VisualEditor News #1—2015 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|300px|right|frameless|alt=VisualEditor]]
Since the last newsletter, the  [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's appearance, the coming Citoid reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. 
Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on mediawiki.org]]. Upcoming plans are posted at the  [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].  

The Wikimedia Foundation has named [[:mw:Wikimedia_Engineering/2014-15_Goals#Top_departmental_priorities_for_Q3_.28January-March_2015.29|its top priorities for this quarter]] (January to March). The first priority is making VisualEditor ready for deployment by default to all new users and logged-out users at the remaining large Wikipedias. You can help identify these requirements. <mark>There will be weekly '''triage meetings '''which''' will be open to volunteers''' beginning Wednesday, 11 February 2015 at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150211T12&p1=224&ah=1 12:00 (noon) PST] (20:00 UTC). </mark> Tell Vice President of Engineering [[:foundation:User:Damon_Sicore_(WMF)|Damon Sicore]], Product Manager [[:mw:User:Jdforrester_(WMF)|James Forrester]] and other team members which bugs and features are most important to you. The decisions made at these meetings will determine what work is necessary for this quarter's goal of making VisualEditor ready for deployment to new users. The presence of volunteers who enjoy contributing MediaWiki code is particularly appreciated. Information about how to join the meeting will be posted at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]] shortly before the meeting begins. 

Due to some breaking changes in MobileFrontend and VisualEditor, VisualEditor was not working correctly on the mobile site for a couple of days in early January. The teams apologize for the problem. 

=== Recent improvements === 

The''' new design for VisualEditor''' aligns with MediaWiki's [[mw:Frontend standards group|Front-End Standards]] as led by the Design team. Several new versions of the [[mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]] library have also been released, and these also affect the appearance of VisualEditor and other MediaWiki software extensions. Most changes were minor, like changing the text size and the amount of white space in some windows. Buttons are consistently color-coded to indicate whether the action:
* starts a new task, like opening the {{int:visualeditor-toolbar-savedialog}} dialog: <span style="background-color: #015ccc; color:white"> blue </span>, 
* takes a constructive action, like inserting a citation:  <span style="background-color: #008c6d; color:white"> green </span>,
* might remove or lose your work, like removing a link:  <span style="background-color: #a7170f; color:white">  red </span>,  or  
* is neutral, like opening a link in a new browser window:  <span style="color: 757575">  gray </span>.  
The '''TemplateData editor''' has been completely re-written to use a different design based on the same OOjs UI system as VisualEditor.   ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T67815 T67815], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73746 T73746].) This change fixed a couple of existing bugs and improved usability. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73077 T73077], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73078 T73078].) 

'''Search and replace''' in long documents is now faster. It does not highlight every occurrence if there are more than 100 on-screen at once.([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T78234 T78234].)

Editors at the Hebrew and Russian Wikipedia requested the ability to use VisualEditor in the "Article Incubator" or drafts namespace. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T86688 T86688], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T87027 T87027].) If your community would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''' on your wiki, then you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.

=== Looking ahead === 

The Editing team will soon add '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. The '''[[mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[w:URL|URL]] or [[w:en: Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for ISBNs, PMIDs, and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to contribute to the Citoid service's definitions for each website, to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections.   

We will need editors to help test the '''new design of the special character inserter''', especially if you speak Welsh, Breton, or another language that uses diacritics or special characters extensively. The new version should be available for testing next week. Please contact [[:en:User:Whatamidoing (WMF)|User:Whatamidoing (WMF)]] if you would like to be notified when the new version is available. After the special character tool is completed, VisualEditor will be deployed to all users at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5 Wikipedias]]. This will affect about 50 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans, Azerbaijani, Breton, Kyrgyz, Macedonian, Mongolian, Tatar, and Welsh'''. The date for this change has not been determined. 

=== Let's work together ===

== Inspire Campaign: Improving diversity, improving content ==

This March, we’re organizing an Inspire Campaign to encourage and support new ideas for improving gender diversity on Wikimedia projects. Less than 20% of Wikimedia contributors are women, and many important topics are still missing in our content. We invite all Wikimedians to participate. If you have an idea that could help address this problem, please get involved today! The campaign runs until March 31.

All proposals are welcome - research projects, technical solutions, community organizing and outreach initiatives, or something completely new! Funding is available from the Wikimedia Foundation for projects that need financial support. Constructive, positive feedback on ideas is appreciated, and collaboration is encouraged - your skills and experience may help bring someone else’s project to life. Join us at the Inspire Campaign and help this project better represent the world’s knowledge!

== Stewards confirmation rules ==

Hello, I made [[:m:Requests_for_comment/Confirmation_of_stewards|a proposal on Meta]] to change the rules for the steward confirmations. Currently consensus to remove is required for a steward to lose his status, however I think it's fairer to the community if every steward needed the consensus to keep.

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's performance, the [[:mw:Citoid|Citoid]] reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. Status reports are posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on Mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

The weekly '''task triage meetings''' continue to be open to volunteers, each Wednesday at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150401T11&p1=224&am=30 11:00 (noon) PDT] (18:00 UTC).  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|Editing team's Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]]. 
=== Recent improvements ===
VisualEditor is now substantially faster.  In many cases, opening the page in VisualEditor is now faster than opening it in the wikitext editor. The new system has improved the code speed by 37% and [[:mw:RESTBase|network speed]] by almost 40%.

The Editing team is slowly adding '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. This is currently available only at the French, Italian, and English Wikipedias.  The '''[[:mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for [[:en:ISBN|ISBNs]], [[:en:PubMed#PubMed_identifier|PMIDs]], and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections by contributing to the Citoid service's definitions for each website.

Citoid requires good [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your citation templates.  If you would like to request this feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the TemplateData for the most important citation templates on your wiki.

The '''special character inserter''' has been improved, based upon feedback from active users.  After this, VisualEditor was made available to all users of Wikipedias on the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5]] list on 30 March.  This affected 53 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans''', '''Azerbaijani''', '''Breton''', '''Kyrgyz''', '''Macedonian''', '''Mongolian''', '''Tatar''', and''' Welsh'''. 

Work continues to support languages with complex requirements, such as Korean and Japanese.  These languages use [[w:input method editor|input method editors]] ("IMEs”).  Recent improvements to cursoring, backspace, and delete behavior will simplify typing in VisualEditor for these users.

The design for the image selection process is now using a "masonry fit" model.  Images in the search results are displayed at the same height but at variable widths, similar to bricks of different sizes in a masonry wall, or the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Images#Mode parameter|"packed" mode in image galleries]].  This style helps you find the right image by making it easier to see more details in images.

You can now '''drag and drop categories''' to re-arrange their order of appearance ​on the page.

The pop-up window that appears when you click on a reference, image, link, or other element, is called the "context menu".  It now displays additional useful information, such as the destination of the link or the image's filename.  The team has also added an explicit "Edit" button in the context menu, which helps new editors open the tool to change the item.

'''Invisible templates are marked by a puzzle piece icon''' so they can be interacted with. Users also will be able to see and edit HTML anchors now in section headings.

Users of the TemplateData GUI editor can now set a string as an optional text for the 'deprecated' property in addition to boolean value, which lets you tell users of the template what they should do instead. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90734 T90734])

=== Looking ahead ===
The special character inserter in VisualEditor will soon use the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki will also have the option of creating a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Instructions for customizing the list will be posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].

The team is discussing a test of VisualEditor with new users at the English Wikipedia, to see whether they have met their goals of making VisualEditor suitable for those editors.  The timing is unknown, but might be relatively soon. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90666 T90666])

=== Let's work together ===

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|Nominations are being accepted for 2015 Wikimedia Foundation elections]] ==

''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Committee|2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/MassMessages/Accepting nominations|Translations]] are available.''
[[File:Wmf logo vert pms.svg|100px|right]]
Greetings,

I am pleased to announce that nominations are now being accepted for the 2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections. This year the Board and the FDC Staff are looking for a diverse set of candidates from regions and projects that are traditionally under-represented on the board and in the movement as well as candidates with experience in technology, product or finance. To this end they have [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|published letters]] describing what they think is needed and, recognizing that those who know the community the best are the community themselves, the election committee is [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|accepting nominations]] for community members you think should run and will reach out to those nominated to provide them with information about the job and the election process.

This year, elections are being held for the following roles:

''Board of Trustees''<br/>
The Board of Trustees is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long term sustainability of the Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection.  There are three positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/Board elections/2015|the board elections page]].    

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)''<br/>
The Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) makes recommendations about how to allocate Wikimedia movement funds to eligible entities.  There are five positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC elections/2015|the FDC elections page]].

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) Ombud''<br/>
The FDC Ombud receives complaints and feedback about the FDC process, investigates complaints at the request of the Board of Trustees,  and summarizes the investigations and feedback for the Board of Trustees on an annual basis.

== Pywikibot compat will no longer be supported - Please migrate to pywikibot core ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<small>Sorry for English, I hope someone translates this.</small><br />
[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot|Pywikibot]] (then "Pywikipediabot") was started back in 2002. In 2007 a new branch (formerly known as "rewrite", now called "core") was started from scratch using the MediaWiki API. The developers of Pywikibot have decided to stop supporting the compat version of Pywikibot due to bad performance and architectural errors that make it hard to update, compared to core.  If you are using pywikibot compat it is likely your code will break due to upcoming MediaWiki API changes (e.g. [[phab:T101524|T101524]]). It is highly recommended you migrate to the core framework. There is a  [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot/Compat deprecation|migration guide]], and please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot/Communication|contact us]] if you have any problem.

There is an upcoming MediaWiki API breaking change that compat will not be updated for. If your bot's name is in [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-June/081931.html this list], your bot will most likely break.

Thank you,<br />
The Pywikibot development team, 19:30, 5 June 2015 (UTC)

# Visit the page [[Special:ContentTranslation]] or to your contributions page to open the tool. 
# Click on the blue button to create a new translation. 
# A dialog will be displayed. In the From section select the language of the original article and the article name, and the language you would like to translate to. Also add the title of the new article (or the original title will be inserted) and click on Translate to begin. Your language preferences will be remembered for the next time. 
# You will see a screen consisting of three columns. The left column contains the text of the source language and the middle column is for the translated text. Using the right column you can perform several actions such as insert source text, remove the inserted text source text, add or remove links etc.  
# After you translate the article, you can publish it directly as a new page on the Picard Wikipedia by using the publish button that appears. In case the article gets created by another user while you  were translating, you will see an option to save the newly published translation under your user namespace.  
# The number of published pages can be seen on the [[Special:CXStats|Content Translation stats page]]. 

Since, this is the first time we have installed the tool on this Wikipedia, there are chances that there may be some problems or service disruptions which we are not yet aware of. We will be monitoring the usage to check for any failures or issues, but please do let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Content_translation|Content Translation talk page]] or through [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101962 Phabricator] if you spot any problems that prevent you from using the tool.

<br><br>

<br>
There are separate tabs for linking to internal and external pages.
[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has more information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has created new interfaces for the link and citation tools and fixed many bugs and changed some elements of the design.  Some of these bugs affected users of VisualEditor on mobile devices. Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|test of VisualEditor's effect on new editors]] at the English Wikipedia has just completed the first phase.  During this test, half of newly registered editors had VisualEditor automatically enabled, and half did not.  The main goal of the study is to learn which group was more likely to save an edit and to make productive, unreverted edits.  Initial [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study#Results|results will be posted at Meta]] later this month.    
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features''' '''for citations''' are available at a few Wikipedias through the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]'''.  Citoid takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation.  If Citoid is enabled on your wiki, then the design of the citation workflow changed during May.  All citations are now created inside a single tool.  Inside that tool, choose the tab you want ({{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-auto}}, {{int: citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-manual}}, or {{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-reuse}}).  The cite button is now labeled with the word "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" rather than a book icon, and the autofill citation dialog now has a more meaningful label, "{{Int:Citoid-citeFromIDDialog-lookup-button}}", for the submit button.

The '''link tool''' has been redesigned based on feedback from Wikipedia editors and user testing.  It now has two separate sections:  one for links to articles and one for external links. When you select a link, its pop-up context menu shows the name of the linked page, a thumbnail image from the linked page, Wikidata's description, and appropriate icons for disambiguation pages, redirect pages and empty pages (where applicable). Search results have been reduced to the first five pages.  Several bugs were fixed, including a dark highlight that appeared over the first match in the link inspector.  ([[phab:T98085|T98085]])

The '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor now uses the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki can also create a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Please read the instructions for customizing the list [[mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].  Also, there is now a tooltip to describing each character in the special character inserter. ([[phab:T70425|T70425]])

Several improvements have been made to '''templates'''.  When you search for a template to insert, the list of results now contains descriptions of the templates. The parameter list inside the template dialog now remains open after inserting a parameter from the list, so that users don’t need to click on "{{Int:visualeditor-dialog-transclusion-add-param}}" each time they want to add another parameter.  ([[phab:T95696|T95696]]) The team added a '''new property for TemplateData''', "{{int: templatedata-doc-param-example}}", for template parameters.  This optional, translatable property will show up when there is text describing how to use that parameter. ([[phab:T53049|T53049]])

The '''design''' of the main toolbar and several other elements have changed slightly, to be consistent with the MediaWiki theme.  In the Vector skin, individual items in the menu are separated visually by pale gray bars.  Buttons and menus on the toolbar can now contain both an icon and a text label, rather than just one or the other. This new design feature is being used for the cite button on wikis where the Citoid service is enabled.

The team has released a long-desired improvement to the handling of '''non-existent images'''.  If a non-existent image is linked in an article, then it is now visible in VisualEditor and can be selected, edited, replaced, or removed.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=VisualEditor/Feedback&lqt_method=talkpage_new_thread mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Wednesday at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|VisualEditor Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  
* If your Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, or other community wants to have VisualEditor made available by default to contributors, then please contact [[:m:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]]. 
* If you would like to request the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the [[:mw:Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]]  for the most important citation templates on your wiki. 
*The team is planning the second VisualEditor-related "translathon" for July. Please follow [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91108 this task on Phabricator] for details and updates! Announcements will follow in due course.

Buttons and menus on the toolbar can now contain both an icon and a text label, rather than just one or the other. This new design feature is being used for the cite button on wikis where the Citoid service is enabled.

The team has released a long-desired improvement to the handling of '''non-existent images'''.  If a non-existent image is linked in an article, then it is now visible in VisualEditor and can be selected, edited, replaced, or removed.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=VisualEditor/Feedback&lqt_method=talkpage_new_thread mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Wednesday at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|VisualEditor Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  
* If your Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, or other community wants to have VisualEditor made available by default to contributors, then please contact [[:m:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]]. 
* If you would like to request the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the [[:mw:Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]]  for the most important citation templates on your wiki. 
*The team is planning the second VisualEditor-related "translathon" for July. Please follow [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91108 this task on Phabricator] for details and updates! Announcements will follow in due course.

== HTTPS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Apologies for writing in English.

Hi everyone.

Over the last few years, the Wikimedia Foundation has [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/08/01/future-https-wikimedia-projects/ been working] towards enabling [[m:Special:MyLanguage/HTTPS|HTTPS]] by default for all users, including unregistered ones, for better privacy and security for both readers and editors. This has taken a long time, as there were different aspects to take into account. Our servers haven't been ready to handle it. The Wikimedia Foundation has had to balance sometimes conflicting goals.

[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/ Forced HTTPS] has just been implemented on all Wikimedia projects. Some of you might already be aware of this, as a few Wikipedia language versions were converted to HTTPS last week and the then affected communities were notified.

Most of Wikimedia editors shouldn't be affected at all. If you edit as registered user, you've probably already had to log in through HTTPS. We'll keep an eye on this to make sure everything is working as it should. Do get in touch with [[:m:HTTPS#Help!|us]] if you have any problems after this change or contact me if you have any other questions.

== Proposal to create PNG thumbnails of static GIF images ==

[[File:(R)-3-phenyl-cyclohanone.png|255px|thumb|How a PNG thumb of this GIF would look like]]

There is a [[w:c:Commons:Village_pump/Proposals#Create_PNG_thumbnails_of_static_GIF_images|proposal]] at the Commons Village Pump requesting feedback about the thumbnails of static GIF images: It states that static GIF files should have their thumbnails created in PNG. The advantages of PNG over GIF would be visible especially with GIF images using an alpha channel. (compare the thumbnails on the side)

This change would affect all wikis, so if you support/oppose or want to give general feedback/concerns, please post them to the [[w:c:Commons:Village_pump/Proposals#Create_PNG_thumbnails_of_static_GIF_images|proposal page]].

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is coming ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

When using data from Wikidata on Wikipedia and other sister projects, there is currently a limitation in place that hinders some use cases: data can only be accessed from the corresponding item. So, for example, the Wikipedia article about Berlin can only get data from the Wikidata item about Berlin but not from the item about Germany. This had technical reasons. We are now removing this limitation. It is already done for many projects. Your project is one of the next ones. We will roll out this feature here on August 12.

We invite you to play around with this new feature if you are one of the people who have been waiting for this for a long time. If you have technical issues/questions with this you can come to [[d:Wikidata:Contact the development team]].

A note of caution: Please be careful with how many items you use for a single page. If it is too many pages, loading might get slow. We will have to see how the feature behaves in production to see where we need to tweak and how.

How to use it, once it is enabled:
* Parser function: <nowiki>{{#property:P36|from=Q183}}</nowiki> to get the capital from the item about Germany
* Lua: see [[mw:Extension:Wikibase Client/Lua]]

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is here ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

Hi everyone,

As I have previously announced here we have now enabled the arbitrary access feature here. This means from now on you can make use of data from any Wikidata item in any article here. Before you could for example only access data about Berlin in the article about Berlin. If you want to find out more or have questions please come to [[d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access]]. I hope this will open up great possibilities for you and make your work easier.

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] have been working on mobile phone support. They have fixed many bugs and improved language support.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving language support and functionality on mobile devices.   

=== Wikimania ===
The team attended Wikimania 2015 in Mexico City. There they participated in the Hackathon and met with individuals and groups of users. They also made several presentations about [[c:File:How_we_made_VisualEditor_faster.pdf|VisualEditor]] and the [[:c:File:Wikimania_2015_–_Editing_Department_–_Beyond_Editing.pdf|future of editing]]. 

Following Wikimania, we announced winners for the [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon VisualEditor 2015 Translathon]. Our thanks and congratulations to users ''Halan-tul'', ''Renessaince'', ''<span lang="ne" dir="ltr">जनक राज भट्ट</span> (Janak Bhatta)'', ''Vahe Gharakhanyan'', ''Warrakkk'', and ''Eduardogobi''.

For '''interface messages''' (translated at [https://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net]), we saw the initiative affecting 42 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 56.5% before the translathon, and 78.2% after ('''+21.7%'''). In particular, Sakha improved from 12.2% to 94.2%; Brazilian Portuguese went from 50.6% to 100%; Taraškievica went from 44.9% to 85.3%; Doteli went from 1.3% to 41.2%. Also, while 1.7% of the messages were outdated across all languages before the translathon, the percentage dropped to 0.8% afterwards (-0.9%).   

For '''documentation messages''' (on mediawiki.org), we saw the initiative affecting 24 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 26.6% before translathon, and 46.9% after ('''+20.3%''').  There were particularly notable achievements for three languages. Armenian improved from 1% to 99%; Swedish, from 21% to 99%, and Brazilian Portuguese, from 34% to 83%. Outdated translations across all languages were reduced from 8.4% before translathon to 4.8% afterwards (-3.6%).   

[https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon#Graphs_(interface_messages_only) We published some graphs] showing the effect of the event on the Translathon page. We thank the translators for participating and the translatewiki.net staff for facilitating this initiative.   

=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features for citations''' can be enabled on each Wikipedia.  The tool uses the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]''' to convert a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] into a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. You can see an animated GIF of the quick, [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/GIFs#Auto-citing_a_source|simple process at mediawiki.org]].  So far, about a dozen Wikipedias have enabled the auto-citation tool.  To enable it for your wiki, follow the [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling_Citoid_on_your_wiki|instructions at mediawiki.org]].

Your wiki can customize the first section of the '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor. Please follow the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Special_characters|instructions at mediawiki.org]] to put the characters you want at the top. 
In other changes, if you need to fill in a [[:mw:CAPTCHA|CAPTCHA]] and get it wrong, then you can click to get a new one to complete.  VisualEditor can now display and edit [[mediawikiwiki:Extension:Graph|Vega-based graphs]]. If you use the Monobook skin, VisualEditor's appearance is now more consistent with other software.     

=== Future changes ===
The team will be changing the '''appearance of selected links''' inside VisualEditor. The purpose is to make it easy to see whether your cursor is inside or outside the link.  When you select a link, the link label (the words shown on the page) will be enclosed in a faint box.  If you place your cursor inside the box, then your changes to the link label will be part of the link.  If you place your cursor outside the box, then it will not.  This will make it easy to know when new characters will be added to the link and when they will not.

On the English Wikipedia, 10% of newly created accounts are now offered both the visual and the wikitext editors.  A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|recent controlled trial]] showed no significant difference in survival or productivity for new users in the short term.  New users with access to VisualEditor were very slightly less likely to produce results that needed reverting.  You can learn more about this by watching a video of the [[mediawikiwiki:Wikimedia_Research/Showcase#July_2015|July 2015 Wikimedia Research Showcase]].  The proportion of new accounts with access to both editing environments will be gradually increased over time. Eventually all new users have the choice  between the two editing environments.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page is now using [[mw:Flow|Flow]] instead of LiquidThreads.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]]  needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|mediawiki.org]] if you can help.  
* If your wiki would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''', you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.
* Please file requests for language-appropriate "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-bold-tooltip}}" and "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-italic-tooltip}}" icons for the styling menu [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dafezmpv6huxg3taml24 in Phabricator].   
* The design research team wants to see how real editors work. Please [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for their research program]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Tuesdays at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q1 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.

New users with access to VisualEditor were very slightly less likely to produce results that needed reverting.  You can learn more about this by watching a video of the [[mediawikiwiki:Wikimedia_Research/Showcase#July_2015|July 2015 Wikimedia Research Showcase]].  The proportion of new accounts with access to both editing environments will be gradually increased over time. Eventually all new users have the choice  between the two editing environments.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page is now using [[mw:Flow|Flow]] instead of LiquidThreads.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]]  needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|mediawiki.org]] if you can help.  
* If your wiki would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''', you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.
* Please file requests for language-appropriate "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-bold-tooltip}}" and "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-italic-tooltip}}" icons for the styling menu [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dafezmpv6huxg3taml24 in Phabricator].   
* The design research team wants to see how real editors work. Please [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for their research program]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Tuesdays at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q1 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.
